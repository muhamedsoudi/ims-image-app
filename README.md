# ims-image-app
This is a simple spring boot REST api application to let users upload pictures for acceptance or rejection. An administrator will login and review all submissions. Accepted pictures will be assigned a URL which can be accessed by all users (without login). Rejected pictures have their pictures removed but the metadata remains.
